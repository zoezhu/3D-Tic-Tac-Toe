# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
A little game named tic-tac-toe, I just make it in 3D.

It is really easy to play.
(1) When the game begins, input '0' for computer first, or '1' for human first. 
(2) Every time when it is human's turn, just input the 3 index of the location you want to put your step, for example '1,1,1', if the input is invalid, the program will notice that and let the human input again until it is valid.

If there is anyone win the game, the program will show the result and end the game.


I give this little program a name - "little ttt", hope you like it! :D
