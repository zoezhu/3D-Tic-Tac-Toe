1.AI ability

Using list to store the conditions at present, the algorithm can know whether people will win by having align 3 marks already in those all 13 trees, and the algorithm will stop 3 align marks to avoid people win. The algorithm itself also can find 3 align marks of its own to win when it is its turn. The program also depends on the marks it already had to decide which location will be the next step, and it will find the next step go through all conditions from almost to win to not win so quickly.
Further more, when people plays a new step, while going through all the conditions containing that new step, that condition in AIâ€™s win condition also will be delete to avoid AI play useless steps in the future.


2.AI Improvement

The algorithm can be more smart if it calculates all the possible following situations before it has a decision of a certain step, and by comparing those all different win possibility to decide which step to make will be much more smart than now.
